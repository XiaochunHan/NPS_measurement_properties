# NPS measurement properties
This repository contains codes for the analyses and figures in the paper which has been published on [biorxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.29.445964v2) and in revision now. In this paper, we systematically examined the effect sizes and test-retest reliabiliy of a well-established multivariate brain measure that tracks pain induced by nociceptive input, the Neurologic Pain Signature (NPS), across __ten__ studies and __442__ participants. 

### Code
* Each folder named by figure names (e.g., `Figure1B_NPS_four_effect_size`) contains codes to plot the corresponding figures and the underlying data analyses.
* The folder named by `More_analyses_codes` contains codes to do the corresponding data analyses without figure ploting.
* The folder named by `Utils` contains customized functions for this repository.
* __Dependecies__: Before running codes in this repository, you need to add [CanlabCore Toolbox](https://github.com/canlab/CanlabCore) to your path with subfolders.

### Source data
* The source data for all analyses and figures is available [here on the osf](https://osf.io/v9px7/). After downloading these files, you could save them in a folder named by `Osf_data` and run the codes.
